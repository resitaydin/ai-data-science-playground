# AI & Data Science Playground

This repository contains a growing collection of Jupyter notebooks that explore key topics in data science and artificial intelligence. It's a hands-on learning space where I experiment with various techniques, tools, and tutorials as part of my journey in the field.

## ðŸ§  Topics Covered

- Explorations in data analysis, preprocessing, visualization, and classic machine learning.
- Experiments with deep learning, neural networks, and modern NLP models using TensorFlow, PyTorch, and HuggingFace.
- Experiments with modern frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex, covering topics such as embeddings, vector databases (e.g., FAISS, Chroma), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), AI agents and hybrid search pipelines.
- Workflow tips, reproducible environments, and tooling (e.g., `uv`).

## ðŸ“¦ Environment Management

This project uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast and reproducible Python dependency management.

## Structure

- data-science/ â€“ Notebooks focused on data analysis and ML fundamentals
